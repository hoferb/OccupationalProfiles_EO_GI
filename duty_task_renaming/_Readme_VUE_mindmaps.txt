The duties and tasks collected as elements of occupational profiles were partly renamed 
with the objective to reduce the total number of duties respectively tasks. In order 
to identify, which duties or tasks can be provided with the same name, they were 
regrouped in VUE (the visual understanding environment). Results are provided as .pdf and
.vue files.

Color coding: 
duties mindmap: brown are assigned labels; in bluish the duties renamed with the provided
label; red are duties of a specific profile (INSPIRE specialist) that were not included 
in the final mapping.

tasks mindmap: green are the assigned lables; bluish and lila are the tasks that received
this label; red are tasks that required additional discussions with experts.
